We successfully reproduced the baseline and obtained the results presented in our tables by following the instructions provided in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/eth-sri/SafeCoder/tree/main. 
The model directories are substantial, as most are 7B parameter models. Therefore, we opted to include only a representative subset: one finetuned coding LM with safecoder, and finetuned general-purpose LM with safecoder. 
The general-purpose model is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EgLA6UtEhyajFBWfZd8WWjLuuqkYo4nY
